# Telegram Web Auth & Automation Helper 🌐

A robust Python utility designed to streamline the authentication process for **Telegram Web (K Version)**. This tool bridges the gap between the Telegram API (Backend) and Browser Automation (Frontend), creating persistent sessions ideal for automated workflows such as chat screenshotting, scraping, or testing.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **seamless Authentication**: Automatically intercepts Login OTP codes from Telegram Service Notifications (ID 777000) via Pyrogram API - no need to check your mobile device manually.
- **Persistent Browser Sessions**: Generates and maintains a dedicated Chrome user profile (`user_data_dir`). Once logged in, the session remains active indefinitely, enabling headless automation without re-login.
- **Multi-Factor Support**: Handles 2FA (Cloud Password) automatically during the login process.
- **Dual Login Methods**:
  - **QR Code Mode**: Display and scan QR codes directly from the terminal.
  - **Phone Number Mode**: Manual input with automatic OTP fetching.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Google Chrome** installed on the system.

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ululazmi18/telegram-web-auth-helper.git
    cd telegram-web-auth-helper
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install pyrofork playwright
    playwright install chromium
    ```

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Run the Script
Execute the main script to start the authentication process:

```bash
python tg_web_auth.py
```

### 2. Choose Login Method
If no session exists, the interactive menu will prompt you:

-   **[1] QR Code Login**: Use your phone to scan the QR code generated by the tool.
-   **[2] Phone Number Login**: Enter your number. The tool will auto-fetch the OTP code sent to your Telegram account.

### 3. Browser Automation Ready
Once authenticated, a `.session` file and a corresponding `*_chrome` folder will be created. You can now use this persistent context for any Playwright automation task (e.g., taking screenshots) without being asked to log in again.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `tg_web_auth.py`: Main authentication and session management script.
- `*.session`: Pyrogram session file (Backend API access).
- `*_chrome/`: Persistent Chrome user data directory (Frontend Browser access).
